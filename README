The goal of this project is to:

Implement a Linux kernel character device driver to pass messages between two
processes.  The message passing should be bi-directional.  Also implement a
series of ioctls that can transform the messages as they pass through the
kernel:

1) An ioctl to ROT13 encode the message.
2) An ioctl to base64 encode the message.
3) An ioctl to reverse the message.
